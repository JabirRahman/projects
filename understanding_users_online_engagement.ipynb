This is interesting becuase most of the offices close after 5 pm or the earliest at 4 pm. Our results indicate that many people after their lunch break tend to spend time in less stressful or less mentally demanding activities. Does it imply that companies and businesses better start their offices rather very early, maybe at 6 am and close it after 2 pm? That would be something very interesting.   "
